1. Download the code as zip and extract it to your preferred directory.
2. From 'task_0' to 'task_4', try them as they are using a php enabled `code editor / IDE`.
3. For `task_2_Interface_Implementation.php`, you have to assign a valid log file path (which has no permission related problem) to `$logFile` at line 46.
4. For the `ToDoModule` directory, that is the 'CRUD' project, open the `ToDoModule` directory path in terminal. Then:

- Run `php artisan migrate` and select 'sqlite' as database, then confirm hitting 'yes' to create the db.
- Run `php artisan db:seed` to seed in db.
- Open the url `http://localhost:8000` to try the 'CRUD' project.
- Use `test@example.com` as username and `password` as password.

Thank you!
